It's been a while since the last post, hasn't it? 

I've been applying to some more job listings lately and figured it was about time I pushed some sort of update--- In this case, the "About" page is now accurate. The "Archive" page may be implemented at some point, maybe soon™, depending on how my job hunt goes for me in the near future.

Also, The cover picture for this post is one of the Hubble Deep Field images. It's also one of my desktop backgrounds. I thought it looked nice.

Till next time,
